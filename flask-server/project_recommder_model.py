Additionally, offer detailed step-by-step guidance on how they can execute their project idea or research topic, acquire the necessary resources, and go further in their project implementation.

    An example of recommended roadmaps is for web-development:-
    Complete Frontend Developer Roadmap [With Resources] Step 1: Learn HTML Step 2: Learn CSS Step 3: Learn JavaScript Step 4: Learn Git and GitHub Step 5: CSS Architecture and Preprocessors Step 6: Learn Framework [React Recommend] Step 7: Modern CSS Step 8: CSS Frameworks [ Tailwind recommend] Step 9: Learn Authentication Strategies Step 10: Progressive Web Apps [optional] Step 11: Server-Side Rendering [Next Js, Nuxt Js] (optional) [Free Resources At the End] - For Html HTML is the backbone of any website. It's responsible for the structure and content of the webpage. Here's what to focus on: - Basic HTML syntax - Forms and inputs - Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model) - Semantic HTML (how to structure your HTML to convey meaning and improve accessibility) - SEO basics - For CSS CSS is what makes websites look good. It's all about the design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. - Basic CSS syntax - CSS box model - Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout designs - Responsive design principles - Animation with CSS - CSS variables - Learn CSS Preprocessors (Sass or Less) Preprocessors add extra functionality to CSS like variables, mixins, and functions which make CSS more maintainable. - Setting up a preprocessor - Sass or Less syntax - Creating variables and mixins - Nesting CSS rules - For Javascript JavaScript is the scripting language used to make webpages interactive. It's essential to learn both the basics and the advanced parts of JavaScript. - Syntax and basic constructs - Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await) - ES6+ concepts (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, modules etc.) - DOM Manipulation and events - JSON and data fetching (Ajax, fetch API) - Understanding the concept of closures, and prototypal inheritance - Learn Git and GitHub Git is a version control system that helps you to keep track of changes made to the project. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. -Basic command line commands - Basic Git commands (add, commit, push, pull) - Branching and merging - Resolving merge conflicts - Using GitHub (creating repositories, pull requests, and issues) - Learn a JavaScript Framework/Library (React recommended) React is a popular JavaScript library for building interactive UI components. - Understanding the virtual DOM - React components (Functional and Class) - State and props - Component lifecycle methods (for class components) or hooks (for functional components) - Making API calls in React - Routing with React Router - State management with Context API, Redux, or MobX (knowing one is generally enough, but each has its own use cases) - Modern CSS (CSS-in-JS, CSS Modules) Modern front-end development often involves component-based styles. - CSS Modules - Styled Components - Emotion - JSS - CSS Frameworks (Tailwind CSS recommended) Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. - Understanding utility-first CSS - Tailwind CSS syntax - Configuring Tailwind CSS - Responsiveness in Tailwind CSS - Learn Authentication Strategies Most apps will require user authentication in some form. - OAuth - JWT - Understanding sessions - Implementing authentication in React Resources Html and CSS (freecodecamp) - https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc CSS - https://youtu.be/OXGznpKZ_sA SCSS and LESS - https://youtu.be/_a5j7KoflTs Javascript https://youtu.be/SBmSRK3feww Javascript Projects https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjVLYmrlmjGcZJ0oMwKkgwJ8XkCDAb9aG The Best Way
